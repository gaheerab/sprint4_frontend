Why we created Melody Mates:

To connect people through their shared love of music. The site offers features like artist recommendations, personalized user profiles, and more. These elements foster meaningful interactions  while engaging in a collaborative, safe community. 

Chatroom:
- Used HTML to for the login form, user list, and chatbox
- JavaScript was used for user login and user selection
- used an if statement to make sure the user dosen't continue without entering a username 

login page:
- conditional statements (if-else) which allows responses to proceed
- html forms the login using input and button elements to collect data
